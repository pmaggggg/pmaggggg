I am a Data Analyst at The Information Lab with 1.5 years of consulting experience designing, building, and implementing client-focused data solutions across a wide range of industries, using a variety of technologies. My primary focus has been within the Finance sector, specialising in extracting insights from financial data. My technical tools of choice are SQL / Alteryx for data cleaning and preparation, with Tableau as my reporting tool of choice, alongside some Power BI.

I have a backbround in Economics, having completed a 1st Class Honours degree at King's College London. 

I am keen to continue to grow and learn within data. On my profile you will see visualisation projects, coding practice, and possibly me diving into new tools as I expand my skill set.
